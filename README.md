 Just the default config but with some changes ie faster
 animatons, pywall border colors + shadow 

Im hoping to change more things in the future but just didnt find the time 

# Shell 
 For the shell I use zsh 
 I use OMZ (Oh My ZSH) for plugins 
 The plugins that I use can be gotten from here:
 Other than that the ./ZSHRC files has some aliases which are:
- [Alias] > [Command]
- CD > zoxide 
- cat > bat 
- ls > exa 
These are the main ones that I use for more info check the /.ZSRC they can be found at the bottom
Btw uses fastfetch on launch
