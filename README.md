#  Hyprland.conf
  -WARNING-
  You may need to change some of the flies paths / settings to adjust to your own
  - I pywall should work but make sure to create the template since i havent yet finished configuring pywall thus havenet added it      yet.
  - This file will have to be updated soon since i change many things (+ I will try to make it auto set things like monitors or use ~ for file paths instead of /home/USR/
    # KEYBINDS
    (using defualt hyprland binds for most of it.
